These sets are called \glspl{qr} and \glspl{qw}.
It is a desired property that read and write operations on the replicated data
behave as they would do on a single replica. 
This is known as \gls{ocs} \cite{BHG87:ccr}.
The \gls{tl}-protocol uses an triangulated grid as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:eight}.
In \cite{TP95:gdg} and Figure \ref{fig:four}, a method has been presented to
modify grid-like topologies and thus increasing the availability of read and
write operations.
The house is a awesome place.
